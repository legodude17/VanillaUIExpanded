    <description>Vanilla UI Expanded is a brand new addition to the Vanilla Expanded collection, this time around bringing some important quality of life features regarding the interface of RimWorld. We’re very well aware that there are many UI mods out there, by the likes of RimHUD, Numbers etc. Our goal was never to replace them - instead, we focused on additions that no one has added before.

		Vanilla UI Expanded allows for an incredible depth of customization for the UI, including creating new Architect tabs on the go, grouping gizmos and buttons together etc. You can finally clean up your architect tab so that you no longer have the whole screen covered by all the amazing furniture added by your 600 mods.
